   <h1>Projects</h1>
	<h2>Asteroids!</h2>
		<p>Inspired by childhood memories of the origional arcade asteroids game. This front end only site features very simple and clean code to make a little, two player game. Click the asteroid and keep it from destroying the planet!</p>
		<img id="asteroidsSS" src="images/AsteroidsSS.PNG"/>
		
<!-- 	<h2>Overland It!</h2> -->
		<img id="overlanditSS" src="images/OverlandItSS.PNG"/>
		<p>There is no one place on the internet that features a plurality of expedition vehicles for sale. Overland It aggrigates expedition vehicles for sale from a variety of sites and hosts them on a mongoDB database using Node.js and Express.js as the app backend. Angular-Material is used as the front end library. The origional concept was to data scrape expedition vehicles from a few sources and aggrigate them on the site. However, the problem was a bit too big for the solution. There were no sites with more than two expedition vehicles on them so the data was manually added to the database.</p>

	<h2>PrepperPrepper</h2>
		<p>This app is created to help people make better emergency prepardness decisions based on where they live. People can select a city and get a synopsis of the risks from earthquakes, floods and civil unrest present in that city.
		Users can log in, easily input how much water, food and guns they have to get their prepper score based on what they should have for their citie's risks. Paul worked as a developer and PM in a team of four developers to build this site. It is an ongoing project.</p>

	<h2>Decider 3000</h2>
		<p id="deciderText">This was Paul's first full stack web app. It was inspired by several of Paul's friends asking him for help making big decisions. Instead of creating spreadsheets to help make decisions, users can use this web app to keep track of the deciding factors and how much they value them with this app. Hallmark is the feeling you get when it tells you which choice you should choose. Origionally built using Rails. It's currently being rebuilt using Sails as it is a more comtemporary technology.</p>
