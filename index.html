	    	<p>
	    	Working for Cole & Weber and it's subsidiary, Hammerquist, I created lightweight banners for Hawaiian airlines with a variety of animations, images and sizes. Using "vanilla" JavaScript and Sprites, I was able to create total file size under 150kb for fast loading and cross-browser compatibility. As the sole technical person, I was able to readily explain the challanges that arose with the server managers, PMs and graphic designers.

	    <h2>Data Reporting System</h2>
	    	<img src="images/HAReport.png"/>
	    	<p>
	    	Working with the Sr. Data architect at Cole and Weber, I created data intake, deduplication, business logic implementation and publishing procedures. Working closely with the marketing department to get the correct requirements, we used server side SQL, C# and MS Server Management Studio to create a fast reporting system pulling from nearly 100,000 rows of data.

		<h2>Asteroids!</h2>
			<a href="http://physicist-pig-53058.bitballoon.com" target="blank"><img id="asteroidsSS" src="images/AsteroidsSS.png"/></a>
			<p>Inspired by childhood memories of the origional arcade asteroids game. This front end only site features very simple and clean code to make a little, two player game. Click the asteroid and keep it from destroying the planet!</p>
			
		<h2></h2>
			<a href="https://overlanders.herokuapp.com/" target="blank"><img id="overlanditSS" src="images/OverlandItSS.png"/></a>
			<p>There is no one place on the internet that features a plurality of expedition vehicles for sale. Overland It aggrigates expedition vehicles for sale from a variety of sites and hosts them on a mongoDB database using Node.js and Express.js as the app backend. Angular-Material is used as the front end library. The origional concept was to data scrape expedition vehicles from a few sources and aggrigate them on the site. However, the problem was a bit too big for the solution. There were no sites with more than two expedition vehicles on them so the data was manually added to the database.</p>

		<h2>PrepperPrepper</h2>
			<p>This moble responsive web app was created to help people be better prepared for emergencies.
			Users input where they live and are given a snyopsis of earthquake, civil unrest and flood danger for that area. They are given reccomendations for food, water and gun storage and can log in and get their prep score by inputing the number of meals, gallons of water, and guns they have. 
			Paul worked as a developer and PM in a team of four developers to build this site. It is built in Node/express/bootrap with parallax scrolling. I'd like to improve the load time and number of cities available to select from.</p>

		<h2>GearSpoke</h2>
