		<h2>Asteroids!</h2>
			<a href="http://physicist-pig-53058.bitballoon.com" target="blank"><img id="asteroidsSS" src="images/AsteroidsSS.png"/></a>
			<p>Inspired by childhood memories of the origional arcade asteroids game. This front end only site features very simple and clean code to make a little, two player game. Click the asteroid and keep it from destroying the planet!</p>
			
		<h2></h2>
			<a href="https://overlanders.herokuapp.com/" target="blank"><img id="overlanditSS" src="images/OverlandItSS.png"/></a>
			<p>There is no one place on the internet that features a plurality of expedition vehicles for sale. Overland It aggrigates expedition vehicles for sale from a variety of sites and hosts them on a mongoDB database using Node.js and Express.js as the app backend. Angular-Material is used as the front end library. The origional concept was to data scrape expedition vehicles from a few sources and aggrigate them on the site. However, the problem was a bit too big for the solution. There were no sites with more than two expedition vehicles on them so the data was manually added to the database.</p>

		<h2>PrepperPrepper</h2>
			<p>This moble responsive web app was created to help people be better prepared for emergencies.
			Users input where they live and are given a snyopsis of earthquake, civil unrest and flood danger for that area. They are given reccomendations for food, water and gun storage and can log in and get their prep score by inputing the number of meals, gallons of water, and guns they have. 
			Paul worked as a developer and PM in a team of four developers to build this site. It is built in Node/express/bootrap with parallax scrolling. I'd like to improve the load time and number of cities available to select from.</p>

		<h2>GearSpoke</h2>
		<a href="https://www.gearspoke.com/" target="blank"><img id="gearspokeSS" src="images/GearSpokeSS.png" /></a>
			<p>GearSpoke is a site where users can rent their outdoor gear to fellow users. There's no fee to sign up, you can pay the rental fee securly through the site and it only costs 10% of the rental to rent your equipment over the site. 
			<br/> 
			As co-founder | CEO of GearSpoke, Paul learned while doing and was a major part in the development the site and it's community. With three technical developers and one designer, Paul created an easy to use, beautiful site while gaining the respect of his co-founders an mentors. After selling in 2014, Paul was determined to become an expert developer.</p>

	<!-- 	<h2>Decider 3000</h2>
			<p id="deciderText">This was Paul's first full stack web app. It was inspired by several of Paul's friends asking him for help making big decisions. Instead of creating spreadsheets to help make decisions, users can use this web app to keep track of the deciding factors and how much they value them with this app. Hallmark is the feeling you get when it tells you which choice you should choose. Origionally built using Rails. It's currently being rebuilt using Sails as it is a more comtemporary technology.</p>
